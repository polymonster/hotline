## Design Goals
- An easy to use cross platform graphics/os api for rapid development.
- Hot reloadable, live coding environment (shaders, render graphs, code).
- Concise graphics api frontend with low level feature access think somewhere in-between Metal and Direct3D12.
- A focus on modern rendering (gpu-driven, multi-threaded, bindless, ray-tracing).
- With flexibility to easily create and use different rendering strategies (deferred vs forward, gpu-driven vs cpu driven, etc).
- Fibre based, multi-threaded, easily scalable to utilise available cpu cores.
- Data-driven and configurable.
- Plugin based an extendible.

This is very early stages of development, it is also my first major project in rust so it is very much a learning experience too.
