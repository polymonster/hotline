# Hotline

## Design Goals
- An easy to use cross platform graphics/os api for rapid development
- Concise graphics api frontend with low level feature access think somewhere in-between metal and direct3d12
- A focus on modern rendering strategies (gpu-driven, multi-threaded, bindless, ray-tracing)
- Fibre based, multi-threaded, everything async
- Data-driven and configurable render graph
- Hot reloadable everything (shaders, render graphs, code)
- Plugin based an extendible

This is very early stages of development, it is also my first major project in rust so it is very much a learning experience too.
