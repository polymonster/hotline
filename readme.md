# Hotline

Hotline aims to be:
- an easy to use cross platform graphics/os api for rapid development
- a focus on modern rendering strategies (gpu-driven, multi-threaded, bindless, ray-tracing)
- fibre based, multi-threaded, everything async
- data-driven and configurable render graph
- hot reloadable everything (shaders, render graphs, code)
- plugin based an extendible

This is very early stages of development, it is also my first major project in rust so it is very much a learning experience too.
